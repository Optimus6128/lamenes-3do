An attempt at porting LameNES to the 3DO.
Currently, it does load ROMS (thanks saffron) but rendering does not work properly...

To run, you must put a NES rom file in the CD folder and pack everything with OperaFS.

Here are the controls :

Dpad            =  NES Dpad
C               =  Select
Pause           =  Start
A               =  A
B               =  B
