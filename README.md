An attempt at porting LameNES to the 3DO.
Currently, it does not seem to work.
(Or maybe it works but the drawing functions doesn't)

To run, you must put a NES rom file in the CD folder and pack everything with OperaFS.
In the future, i think i will use Saffron's OperaTool instead.

If you somehow manage to get it work,
here are the controls :

Dpad            =  NES Dpad (obvious)
C               =  Select
Pause           =  Start
A               =  A
B               =  B
